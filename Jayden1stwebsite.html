<p> 8 million dead in 2019. </p>

	<li>More than three billion people - almost half of earth's population - live on less than $2.50 per day. 1.3 billion people - more than twice the population of North America - live on less than $1.25 per day. In our society, that amount can get you a quarter of a Big Mac hamburger from Macdonalds. When you drink a bottle of juice, you are drinking up the same amount two days of hard labour from these individuals. The average Canadian makes more than 100 times of $1.25 per day.  </li>
	<li> 22,000 children die from poverty every single day. Poverty exposes children to malnutrition, vile water quality, lack of immunizations, lack of sanitization, loss of education, and more. As a result, children are vulnerable to deadly diseases that have been prevented in first world countries like Canada. Some of the major culprits of premature death are measles, malaria and diarrhea. </li>
	<li> The World Food Programme says, “The poor are hungry and their hunger traps them in poverty.” Hunger is the number one cause of death in the world, killing more than HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis combined. </li>

<p> Poverty affects both adults and children alike, killing people all across the globe at unbelievable rates. However, poverty has an especially hard impact on children and newborns, who are relatively weak. Children who grow up in situations where poverty is an issue suffer from severe and frequent health problems while infants who are born into poverty have a high chance of low birth weight, leading to physical and mental disabilities. Impoverished countries often have low access to clean water, low vaccination rates, and are often the perfect breeding ground for disease spreading insects such as mosquitoes. This, when coupled with how weak children already are in impoverished countries, means that child mortality rate is incredibly high. In countries where poverty hits the hardest, an infant born in poverty that manages to survive one year of life is a rarity.

<p> Now, what's the good news? The never ending fight against poverty has been making great strides in the past decades; since 1990, around 25% of the world’s population has risen out of extreme poverty. The settings where poverty takes place - often in slums and certain areas of Africa - have become more liveable than in the twentieth century with much fewer conflicts. However, the rate at which people are coming out of extreme poverty is slowing, and there are still billions of people living in poverty around the world. It seems as if the world has progressed into the future while the billions of individuals stuck in such horrific circumstances continue to suffer.

<p>  The issue with poverty is that it is very hard to escape the cycle, generation after generation. As the World Food Programme puts it, “The poor are hungry and their hunger traps them in poverty.” Although hunger is a major factor in why impoverished people stay impoverished, there are a variety of reasons as to why it’s so hard to make enough money to leave poverty when you are born into a poverty-stricken home. First of all, poverty often means missing out on a quality education. This immediately prevents you from taking many high-paying jobs. The jobs that you have available are hard labour, low paying positions that often are difficult to perform with such a weak body. Second of all, when you are born into an impoverished country, you most likely need to take care of your parents when you go out and begin working. In fact, many people who live in poverty try to have as many children as possible so that they could support them with enough money in the future. When you are born with the burden of extra costs, it is difficult to escape poverty even if you make enough money. Finally is limited access to medical care. Many third-world countries don’t have the resources to set up consistent medical care for their citizens. As a result, the impoverished people who have the most medical issues often worsen because they simply have no way to improve their bodies.

<p>  Although we have helped one billion people leave destitute living conditions in less than a  generation, can we keep this rate of improvement up? Well, no. By 2030, the majority of people who live in poverty in South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific will have come out of poverty. However, the number of individuals who will continue to suffer in Sub-Saharan Africa will barely decrease. What’s worse, the vast majority of people who live in poverty stricken areas are in Sub-Saharan Africa, meaning that from 2020 to 2030, there will be only a minor shift from poverty to non-poverty. The rate is slowing down, and we need everyone to contribute if we want to speed up this process. If we all donate, even just a little bit, our contributions add up quickly and become significant.
